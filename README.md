# Awesome Processing in Memory(PIM) [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated list of awesome processing in memory(PIM) works, which includes Architecture & Integrated Circuit(IC). Inspired by [awesome-deep-vision](https://github.com/kjw0612/awesome-deep-vision), [awesome-adversarial-machine-learning](https://github.com/yenchenlin/awesome-adversarial-machine-learning), [awesome-deep-learning-papers](https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers) and [awesome-architecture-search](https://github.com/markdtw/awesome-architecture-search).

Traditional Von Neumann Machines have encountered its limitation, Processing in Memory can help to solve both speed and energy efficiency problems. These are some awesome works!
